      "{'title': 'Risk Factors for Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection During the 2015 Outbreak in South Korea', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND. Transmission heterogeneity was observed during the 2015 Korean outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Only 22 of 186 cases transmitted the infection, and 5 super-spreading events caused 150 transmissions. We investigated the risk factors for MERS-CoV transmission. METHODS. Epidemiological reports were used to classify patients as nonspreaders, spreaders, or those associated with a super-spreading event (5 or more transmissions). Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the factors for MERS-CoV transmission. RESULTS. Compared to nonspreaders, spreaders exhibited a longer interval from symptom onset to isolation (7 days vs 3 days) and more frequent pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses (68.2% vs 17.1%). Spreaders also exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (149 vs 17.5), pre-isolation hospitalization (68.2% vs 16.5%), and emergency room (ER) visits (50% vs 7.3%). Spreaders exhibited lower cycle thresholds for the upE and ORF1a genes (22.7 vs 27.2 and 23.7 vs 27.9, respectively). In multivariate analysis, transmission was independently associated with the cycle threshold (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.96) and pre-isolation hospitalization or ER visits (OR, 6.82; 95% CI, 2.06–22.84). The super-spreading events exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts (777 vs 78), pre-isolation ER visits (100% vs 35.3%), and doctor shopping (100% vs 47.1%) compared to non-super-spreading events. CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that transmission is determined by host infectivity and the number of contacts, whereas super-spreading events were determined by the number of contacts and hospital visits. These relationships highlight the importance of rapidly enforcing infection control measures to prevent outbreaks.', 'introduction': []}\n",

Hospitals, in order to expand capacity, have postponed elective surgical cases in order to avail additional beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. 1 However, this delay has unintended consequences on the health of patients with indications for surgical procedures currently deemed \"non-essential,\" which may reverberate through our health system for years to come.', 'Patients with degenerative, traumatic, and oncological spinal pathologies represent a rapidly growing population, with rates of lumbar spinal fusions nearly quadrupling over three decades. 2, 3 With recent restrictions on \"elective procedures,\" many of these patients are currently living with unaddressed or under-addressed disease processes, which is associated with increased long-term morbidity and mortality. 4 For patients with spinal cord injuries, unstable spinal fractures, or oncological compression, who may exist in a nebulous \"gray zone\" that falls short of the threshold of emergent cases, this means enduring severe myelopathy, radiculopathy, and chronic pain without appropriate intervention. As of the drafting of this article, there are over 690,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, among a global burden of 2.27 million cases, with hospitalization demand projected by some to far exceed available capacity despite the aforementioned measures. 5, 6 Under these circumstances, the resumption of non-emergent surgeries may be months away. Here, we present pre-and post-restriction spinal case volume in the 5200-bed Schoen Clinic, the largest family-owned (i.e. under the equity ownership and management of a member of a single family since its inception) hospital group in Germany, which may provide insight into the extent of the growing queue of patients affected by surgical delay.']}\n",

Virtual in silico screening has repeatedly proven to be useful to meet the special challenges of antiviral drug discovery. Large virtual compound libraries are filtered by different computational screening methods such as docking, ligand-based similarity searches or pharmacophore-based screening, reducing the number of candidate molecules to a smaller set of promising candidates that are then tested biologically. This rational approach makes the drug discovery process more goal-oriented and saves resources in terms of time and money. In this review we discuss how different virtual screening techniques can be applied to antiviral drug discovery, present recent success stories in this field and finally address the main differences between the methods.', 'introduction': ['Viral infections can result not only in acute potentially lethal clinical conditions (e.g. Influenza, Dengue), but also in chronic illnesses (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C) that have to be treated for long periods of time and therefore lead to high expenses for the health care system. Especially the potential of some of these viral infections to reach pandemic dimensions is a major concern these days [1] . A primary challenge in the development of effective antiviral therapies is the high variability of viral genomes, which makes it easy for them to adapt to new conditions rapidly or to develop resistance against used drugs. This fact demands for a fast and effective drug discovery process. In the past decades, computational techniques like virtual screening have proven to be of great use to make the drug development process faster and less expensive [2] . The applications of virtual screening (VS) in the drug development process against viral targets vary. The first steps of target and lead structure identification as well as further steps like compound development and optimization can be rationalized and improved by VS.', 'This review aims to provide an explanation of the methods most commonly employed for VS against viral targets, with an overview of the latest findings achieved in this research field. Here for we focus on the development since 2009. For a review on VS against viral targets before this date see Kirchmair et al. [3] .']}\n",

A variety of cardiovascular presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described so far. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the right ventricle is largely unknown. Due to its pathophysiologic relevance, the right ventricle finds itself in the eye of the storm of corona virus disease of 2019, placing it at higher risk of failure. Increased afterload from acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism, negative inotropic effects of cytokines, and direct angiotensin converting enzyme 2-mediated cardiac injury from SARS-CoV-2 are potential mechanisms of right ventricle dysfunction in corona virus disease of 2019. Early detection and treatment of right ventricle dysfunction may lead to decreased mortality and improved patient outcomes in corona virus disease of 2019.', 'introduction': ['The novel corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality across the globe. The mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal cardiovascular complications. In fact, mortality is markedly higher in COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury than those without (59.6% vs. 8.9%). 1 Clinically, there are a variety of cardiovascular presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection including cardiac ischemia, decompensated heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. 2,3 It is not clear whether these cardiovascular presentations are provoked directly by SARS-CoV-2 or indirectly by cytokine-or stress-induced myocardial dysfunction. Interestingly, a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients with evidence of respiratory distress showed signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH) with mild decrease in Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, though no significant difference in right ventricle (RV) size was noted. 4 However, a recent study did show that non-survivors of COVID-19 without known cardiomyopathy had RV dilation, diminished RV function, and elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. 5 This study demonstrated that evaluation of RV function should be considered as a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. 5 Given the physiological relationship between RV and pulmonary vasculature, we suspect that RV dysfunction and failure is contributing to the rapid hemodynamic deterioration, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death in patients with COVID-19. Here, we identified potential causes of acute RV dysfunction in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.']}\n",

In recently published papers about radiotherapy (RT) in various cancers, there are suggestions to use more hypofractionated RT (HFRT) regimens during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce overall treatment time (1) . Unfortunately, HFRT in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is rarely mentioned and underestimated. SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary STS clinic or RT department might cause a shortage of experienced staff by putting them in quarantine. What is more, the interrupted treatment cannot be continued in other institutions with the maintenance of high-quality care due to lack of necessary knowledge, experience, and equipment. Perioperative conventionally fractionated RT (CFRT), namely between 1.8 and 2.0 Gy per fraction by 5 to 7 weeks, is considered to be a standard regimen in STS (2) . There is growing evidence that preoperative HFRT could be also a possible therapeutic approach and its wide introduction may be a controversial but necessary solution.']}\n",

      "{'title': 'Does COVID-19 Spread Through Droplets Alone?', 'abstract': '', 'introduction': ['The world is in the middle of a historic public health crisis. As of March 30, 2020, over a third of the population in the United States were under \"stay at home\" orders given by state governors to protect the vulnerable and the unexposed. Unprecedented steps have been taken by governments globally to contain the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a rapidly spreading pandemic. This has resulted in more than 690,000 cases and over 33,000 deaths worldwide (Supplementary Table 1 ). The index case of the disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified more than 3 months ago. Since then, public health authorities worldwide have taken aggressive measures to blunt the exponential spread of this coronavirus. Furthermore, several nations, including Italy, Spain, and France, have imposed nationwide lockdown measures to enforce social distancing to further prevent the spread of COVID-19 in their respective countries.', 'While preventative measures have been imposed globally, the observed propagation of COVID-19 has noticeable differences among select nations. Epidemiologic data show that some countries have exponential increases in disease incidence, while others seem to have \"flattened the curve.\" This raises questions of whether a full scientific understanding of disease transmission modes has yet to be attained, and thus whether there are more effective ways to prevent its spread. This brings us to the fundamental question: Does COVID-19 Spread through Droplets Alone?', 'To answer this question, we provide epidemiological observational data in conjunction with known molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss the ability of this novel coronavirus to remain viable on environmental surfaces from hours to days and describe its increased virulence characteristics compared to the previous SARS-CoV-1. These biochemical and molecular properties likely allow this novel coronavirus to employ indirect methods of transmission, including fomites and aerosols, in addition to respiratory droplet transmission (Figure 1) .', 'Public health measures of this aggressive nature have the universal purpose of reducing the exponential rise in incidence rates of disease transmission. Observations made in health outcomes following the 1918 influenza pandemic have guided public health policy regarding these preventative measures. Importantly, during this pandemic, some U.S. cities chose more effective measures to address the spread of the disease, resulting in observable differences in mortality rates across the nation (1). Social distancing is an evidence-based practice to help prevent the transmission of pathogens that are known to spread from person to person within a 3-6 feet distance through respiratory droplets (2, 3) . This practice requires individuals in a community to choose behaviors that increase the physical distance between themselves and others (infected, asymptomatic carriers, or non-infected). Social or physical distancing helps reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 and slows the incidence of the disease by reducing the opportunities for potential viral exposures. Furthermore, this is an excellent example of how integral the public health system and policies are to the proper function of medical FIGURE 1 | COVID-19 potential modes of transmission. This illustration shows three potential ways SARS-CoV-2 can spread from an infected host to a susceptible host. First, it is transmitted person to person (direct contact) through respiratory droplets. These droplets can travel for distances 6 feet or less in air. Second, SARS-CoV-2 is likely transmitted through fomites (indirect contact) for the duration it is viable on environmental surfaces. Third, it is also likely transmitted through aerosols (indirect contact) for distances longer than 6 feet in the air. To establish an infection, SARS-CoV-2 needs to first reach an entry point (eyes, nose, or mouth) on a susceptible host. and healthcare systems. Acting swiftly and mobilizing precautionary measures can substantially aid in flattening the disease incidence curve, thereby reducing the number of critically ill patients who will need medical treatment all at the same time. This, in turn, reduces the burden on the healthcare system that takes care of patients presenting with the most feared complication of COVID-19, i.e., severe bilateral pneumonia (4). This concept, now widely referred to as flattening the curve, gives critically ill patients a fighting chance to survive by obtaining life-saving supportive therapy in hospitals. This, therefore, significantly reduces the mortality rate (1) . If the number of critically ill patients is higher than what can be accommodated in hospitals, many more patients will die due to the lack of life-saving medical attention.', 'The current consensus regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is that it spreads person to person through respiratory droplets (5, 6) . Precautions to prevent the spread by droplets as recommended by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are to (1) wash hands with soap, (2) avoid touching viral entry points, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, (3) cover the mouth when coughing or sneezing, (4) wear a facemask if sick and (5) practice social distancing by putting 6 feet of distance between individuals. In addition to these precautions, governmentmandated social distancing measures such as (6) state lockdowns and (7) \"stay at home\" orders are effective ways to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through droplet transmission. Despite all these aggressive precautionary measures, SARS-CoV-2 has succeeded in establishing an exponentially growing pandemic that has spread to almost every nation in the world (Supplementary Figures 1, 2) .']}\n",

Many regions and countries have \"locked down\" to prevent the spread of the virus, including first Wuhan in China, and countries such as the USA, UK, Germany, India, Poland, and New Zealand. During these lockdown periods, people are only allowed to leave their homes if strictly necessary-e.g., for essential work, exercise, medical care, or to purchase groceries or supplies. Although these lockdowns were initially declared to last for a matter of weeks, Ferguson et al. (2020) suggest that lockdowns may need to be implemented regularly for over a year, in order to manage the burden of COVID-19 on health services. This opinion paper evaluates the emerging and likely consequences of these lockdowns on consumer grocery purchasing habits and their implications for food retail as of early April of 2020, with a particular focus on New Zealand as a case study. In doing so, we draw on classic (e.g., Nowlis, 1995; Suri and Monroe, 2003) and recent (e.g., Sproesser et al., 2018; Bialkova et al., 2020) research on consumer behavior, and identify key areas in need of further research.']}\n",

      "{'title': 'The Perfect Storm: Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic Meets Overfat Pandemic', 'abstract': '', 'introduction': [\"In December, 2019, China's Wuhan city became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause, and by January, Chinese scientists reported to have isolated a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-nCoV), from the infected patients (1, 2) . The virus was later designated coronavirus disease 2019 in February by the World Health Organization (3) .\", 'Other respiratory infectious pathogens, including strains of influenza virus type A and adenovirus (ADV), such as H1N1, H7N9, ADV 7, and ADV 55, often lead to worldwide outbreaks that seriously endanger human health. For example, by the end of 2009, the local H1N1 flu epidemic peaked in most countries with ∼70,000 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients and over 2,500 fatal cases observed across 19 countries (4) .', 'The earliest scientific data on Covid-19 from China shows those most vulnerable to infection have pre-existing illness that includes diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic inflammation (1, 5, 6) . Many of these conditions are caused by excess body fat; a condition termed overfat (7, 8) . The overfat condition itself is a significant yet little discussed risk factor in infectious viral diseases (9, 10) , with overfat negatively affecting immune function and host defense mechanisms (11) . It has been shown that both viral and bacterial pathogenesis is adversely altered in overfat hosts (11) (12) (13) (14) . While the viral infections all have different responses in human hosts, albeit similar, hospitals, and other critical care centers are applying their knowledge and skills concerning influenza to those with Covid-19 until more data and research is available specific to the Covid-19 virus (15) .', 'Some viruses have high intrinsic levels of pathogenicity, mediating significant tissue damage in larger numbers of infected individuals, including smallpox and Ebola, with increased risk of death (16) . While the Covid-19 produces symptoms common in other viral infections (such as fever, dry cough, dyspnea), it targets the lower airways to increase respiratory tissue damage, producing significantly high levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (17) . In addition, some unique clinical features include upper respiratory tract symptoms like rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and sore throat, intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, and tissue infiltration of the upper lobe of the lung (17) . Covid-19 also targets the central nervous system (18) . It may be too early to know whether Covid-19 is capable of immune evasion (the blunting of an effective immune response) associated with increased tissue damage, especially in those with impaired immunity (16) .', 'Currently, there are no specific or effective antiviral drugs, nor vaccines against COVID-19 infection, for potential therapy of humans (17) . This makes prevention through healthier lifestyle an important underutilized and significant preventive measure. While extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, like other infectious agents, are required to control the current outbreak, important preventive measures associated with lifestyle can help reduce the risks of future outbreaks.', 'The early death cases of COVID-19 were shown to occur primarily in elderly people who often have poor immune function that permits faster progression of viral infection (19) . While most viral pandemics have similarities despite different pathogens, most hospitalizations occur among persons <2 years of age or 65 years of age or older, and among patients with certain medical conditions. One exception was during the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), which spread globally, with smaller numbers of severe illnesses reported among persons 65 years of age or older (∼5%) (20) .', 'While children have yet to develop full natural immunity, the elderly may have impaired immune responses. However, age may not be a single susceptibility, as many older individuals are physiologically more functional, possessing healthier lifestyles that include healthy eating and physical activities, in addition to potential genetic benefits (21) .', 'The Covid-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly throughout the world, with few effective tools to help treat those who are sick. Current treatment strategies are limited to quarantine, isolation, and implementation of infection-control measures to prevent spread (22) .', 'As of March 31, 2020, 750,890 cases and 36,405 deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had been reported worldwide (23) .', 'As with reports out of China and Italy, data from the U.S. demonstrates those at higher risk for Covid-19 had chronic conditions, with 78% of COVID-19 patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 94% of hospitalized patients who died had an underlying condition (24) . Underlying conditions included diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema), hypertension, and cancer (1, 5, 6) . Most of these underlying conditions are caused by or are associated with excess body fat (8, 25) .', 'While those ≥65 years of age were more at risk, those admitted to the ICU in the age bracket of 19-64 years also had significantly more chronic illness than those hospitalized without ICU admission (23, 24) . These conditions are primarily caused by excess body fat and its associated chronic inflammation (8, 25) . These and other analyses may be limited by relatively small numbers, missing data due to the burden placed on reporting health departments, and the rapidly rising number of cases (23, 24) .', 'Initial indications in the U.S. showed that fatality was highest in persons aged ≥65 years, 1-3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged 20-54 years, while no fatalities occurred among persons aged ≤19 years (26) . Worldwide, mortality is expected to vary with the underlying chronic illness, with the risks associated with COVID-19 heavily influenced by the presence of these comorbidities (1, 5, 6, 27) .']}\n",

Until now, these discussions have mainly focused on potential overloading of the healthcare system and economic losses, the latter being reinforced by political measures (e.g., lockdowns, curfews, and the closure of non-essential businesses). Although not all the details about its epidemiology are yet clear, deaths related to COVID-19 primarily occur among the elderly and mainly among those with concurrent illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, or diabetes (2, 3). For this reason, more emphasis and adequate solutions to the question \"Who cares?\" with a focus on the elderly in these times of pandemic is needed.

      "{'title': 'Will COVID-19 Mark the End of an Egalitarian National Health Service?', 'abstract': '', 'introduction': [\"The exceptional circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the traditional organisation of healthcare resources allocation in the UK. Since its inception, the National Health Service (NHS) has aimed to regulate risks of ill health in the population by providing an equal and universal provision of healthcare services to residents based on their health status rather than their ability to pay. The rapid spread of this new virus has, however, triggered a shift in paradigm from an egalitarian allocation of healthcare resources to a utilitarian approach, which has led to discussions about society's greatest taboos: death and dying and the economic value of individuals' health.\", \"The rapid growth of COVID-19 cases around the world has also highlighted the difficulties governments have had in dealing with the allocation of scarce resources. Even though the NHS remains publicly funded, the provision of services is now ranking the needs of patients that are directly or indirectly affected by the virus rather than providing equal access to treatment for all. This paper argues that the current government's emergency healthcare policy has thereby favoured a utilitarian approach to healthcare rationing and potentially initiated the end of an egalitarian NHS.\", 'The paper first unpacks why the allocation of healthcare resources is fundamentally a question of justice in Britain and explains why healthcare law and policy require a philosophical approach in times of crucial change and crisis. Secondly, the paper provides a critical analysis of the current situation for the allocation of healthcare resources and the provision of services to patients directly or indirectly affected by the virus. It concludes that the liberal egalitarian conception of distributive justice at the heart of the NHS that aims to guarantee free and equal access to healthcare is now in jeopardy and is being replaced by a utilitarian approach based on a priority ranking of patients for the provision of services at this critical time.']}\n",

      "{'title': 'COVID-19 and smoking: A systematic review of the evidence', 'abstract': 'COVID-19 is a coronavirus outbreak that initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, but it has already evolved into a pandemic spreading rapidly worldwide(1,2). As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak(7,8). Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients’ smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [‘smoking’ OR ‘tobacco’ OR ‘risk factors’ OR ‘smoker*’] AND [‘COVID-19’ OR ‘COVID 19’ OR ‘novel coronavirus’ OR ‘sars cov-2’ OR ‘sars cov 2’] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). Specifically, Zhou et al.(9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al.(10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65–7.63; p=0.2). Huang et al.(11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.(12) from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al.(13) found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58–25.00; p= 0.018). We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases(12). However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98–2.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43–4.04). In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.', 'introduction': []}\n",

Italy currently has the highest COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide, even compared to the People's Republic of China where the number of COVID-19 deaths totaled over 3,000 cases, including potential re-infections. Globally, there are ∼570,000 cases and 26,000 deaths due to COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of March 28, 2020, the number of COVID-19 positive cases in Spain is increasing, with 64,000 infected cases and 5,000 deaths.\", 'In the United States, in the span of a few days, there were 85,000 cases and 1,200 deaths due to COVID-19; Germany has 48,000 confirmed cases, and France has 32,000 cases with 600 deaths 2 .', 'After a short respite with 9,000 COVID-19 cases and only 140 deaths, the infection has resurged and the number of confirmed cases are continuously increasing in South Korea 3 . An analysis of the data in the daily updates communicated by the Civil Protection, showed that most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths are limited to Northern Italy-especially Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont-with the numbers fortunately decreasing toward central and southern Italy, and very few cases documented in Basilicata 1 . The most severely affected regions are also the regions where healthcare services have always been considered excellent; the hospitals of Lombardy and Veneto are the Italian centers of excellence with regard to standard protocols and management for many diseases, especially neoplastic conditions, and there was a high rate of passive migration of patients from the South to northern hospitals.', 'The Lombardy region has a higher number of intensive care and resuscitation beds compared to southern Italy; unfortunately, these places are fast running out of hospital beds and facing challenges in the provision of primary care for conditions other than COVID-19, necessitating the transfer of numerous patients to other regions 4 . The situation would probably have been considerably worse if the regions of Southern Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 cases.', 'These numbers confirm the fact that we are facing a pandemic, which was declared by the WHO a few days ago.']}\n",

Following a decree of the president of the council of ministers on March 9, 2020, people who had moved to the north of the country for mainly work or study purposes returned to their families in the southern regions, thus bringing the infection to these areas. The occurrence of this event led to a need to develop strategies aimed at containing and recording the movements of patients entering hospital settings, and including cancer patients. Based on the scientific literature, 19.4% of coronavirus deaths have occurred in people with oncological comorbidities. This data indicates a connection between anticancer therapies and susceptibility to coronavirus, particularly among lung cancer patients.

As a result, stress management interventions for college students have never been timelier and more relevant. Although there have been a handful of meta-analyses on stress management interventions in different populations, Amanvermez et al.'s (2020) systematic review and meta-analysis of stress management interventions for college students contributes to the literature by separating studies that intervene with highly stressed students, from those that intervene with unselected student populations, restricting studies to guided stress management programs, and excluding interventions that focus on additional aspects to stress. These authors found that guided stress management interventions have moderate effects on stress and anxiety and small-to-moderate effects on depression. Furthermore, they found that target population, type, and length of intervention are important; highly stressed students benefit more than unselected samples, CBT-based interventions have greater effects than other theoretical types, and skills training leads to smaller effects than other types of interventions, with lengthier interventions more beneficial than shorter interventions for highly stressed students.\"]}\n",

There is an ultimate destination in this energy journey toward hydrogen as carbon-free fuel and energy carrier. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 1 which indicates that Carbon/ Hydrogen (C/H) ratio has been decreasing over the centuries and is expected to be zero with hydrogen. This is an indication of a clear move toward carbon-free economy or carbon-free society. There have been some researchers and scientists who have argued about the carbon content of wood being more than the carbon content of coal. There are, however, sources suggesting that C/H ratio of wood is about 10 (a ratio of 1 Hydrogen to 10 Carbons) due to the fact that wood is made of cellulose and lignin and that its composition may change among the types of woods but in bounds. However, one should note that most wood is considered cellulose (for details, see: https://phe.rockefeller.edu/docs/WoodsHtoCratio.pdf). Furthermore, one may argue on point about hydrogen that at present it is mostly produced out of fossil fuels (about 50% from natural gas, 30% from oil, and about 15% from coal) worldwide which may not be seen fully clean. This is true! That's why I provide Figure 2 to illustrate the life cycle emissions in terms CO 2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced which clearly shows that clean hydrogen is needed and has to be produced by using renewable energy sources and nuclear to disassociate water into hydrogen and oxygen in a more environmentally benign manner. Figure 2 clearly indicates that we cannot follow the path of fossil fuels for hydrogen production and rather need to deploy nuclear and renewable energy options for hydrogen production through electrolysis, thermochemical processes, photonic processes, etc.\", 'We are now in global coronavirus pandemic which has been literally affecting everyone, every community, every city, every country, every region, every sector, every economy, etc. Of course, everyone has been impacted by the virus, one way or another by either directly or indirectly.

Further, the stream of disheartening COVID-19 news provides fodder for increased worry and distress, which can be detrimental for people with anxiety disorders. Early cross-sectional surveys in the United States, Canada, and Europe show an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety for the general population, associated with COVID-19 concerns (1). Thus, this crisis is exacerbating existing mental health conditions and creating conditions for the development of new ones. Further, if lessons from other outbreaks such as Ebola (2) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (3) are any indication, even after an outbreak is controlled, there will likely be a substantial increase in need for psychological support.', 'Crucially, this public health crisis will magnify and deepen existing shortcomings of mental health care systems. The US was already facing a mental health crisis before the pandemic: less than half of those with mental illness receive the care that they need (4) . Underserved populations, such as low-income or ethnic minority populations, are disproportionately affected; they show the lowest utilization of mental health services (5) . Early data suggest that underserved populations pay a larger health toll from COVID-19: they show higher mortality rates (6, 7) . They are more likely to work in essential jobs putting them at greater risk of contracting COVID-19, and suffer greater economic consequences. All these factors lead to increased stress and anxiety. We will therefore be faced with an even greater relative shortage of trained professionals and means to mental health care during and after this pandemic.', 'We argue that what we need during a public health crisis like this is a digital mental health revolution: scaling up the delivery of confidential mental health services to patients across a wide range of platforms, from telemental health to mobile interventions such as apps and text messaging. Here, we provide an overview of technological tools which could help to decrease the mental health burden of COVID-19, provide recommendations on how they could be used and scaled-up, and discuss considerations and limitations of mental health technology applications.']}\n",

All NPIs, including Lockdown, lower and delay the peak of cases, making available precious time required for capacity-building. Lockdown also comes with considerable economic, social and cultural costs. 5 There is a need to identify optimal strategies to be implemented after lifting of Lockdown in India. Our study modeled various post-Lockdown scenarios and evaluated key healthcare constraints. Our aim was to identify the scenarios where healthcare availability would not be overwhelmed by the epidemic.']}\n",

Globally, COVID-19 has caused an estimated 4,103,241 cases and 2,82,728 deaths until now (11/05/2020). Wuhan city in Hubei province of China is deemed as its epicenter, where the first COVID-19 case was reported in December 2019. Since, then the virus has spread over 215 countries and territories around the world, with varying spread rates and fatalities (Fanelli and Piazza, 2020) . The worldwide lockdown and social distancing have played a great role to keep the reproduction number in check, and thus controlling the outbreak (Kupferschmidt, 2020) . So far reported fatality rate of the corona virus pandemic is somewhere between normal flu (0.1 to 0.2 %) to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) family of viruses (8 to 10 %). In India, so far the fatality rate is about 3 %, which is half of the world average.', 'Forecasting the future of pandemics, including COVID-19, is difficult. The accuracy of an epidemic and pandemic forecasting largely depends on the data availability and uncertainty estimation. Despite this fact, still forecasting utilizing mathematical models has become crucial to better understand the present circumstances and plan the future. Mathematical models are invaluable tools for analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases (Hethcote, 2000) . In the present work, we provide a statistical forecasting approach for the COVID-19 cases in India and its potential implications for planning and decision making to contain the same.']}\n",

However, because it was a new virus with little known about it and because there was a huge global dearth in the availability of screening and testing equipment, the disease spread rapidly across the world (2) . In fact, it spread so rapidly that by 26th February 2020, the number of new infections outside of China had increased 13-fold when compared to the number of new infections inside of China. Additionally, the number of countries infected with COVID-19 had tripled. On 11th March 2020 WHO declared that COVID-19 could be categorized as a Pandemic. On 27 February 2020, Pakistan reported its first two patients of COVID-19 (3) . The first two cases were from individuals who had recently traveled back to Pakistan from Iran (4).\", 'As of 7 March 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally had surpassed 100,000, with 3,073 of them ending in death.

Coronavirus disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death. Many efforts have been made to identify risk factors predisposing to a severe issue. In the first SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002, hypertension was noted in 9/19 patients who died from SARS-CoV in Toronto (1) . In the two largest cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 published, hypertension is the most common comorbidity in patients with severe disease or in those who died or were ventilated (2, 3) . Nevertheless, these data are not adjusted for age, although age appears to be a strong predictor of adverse outcome (4) and hypertension is a very common finding in older patients. Finally, cohort studies only show correlation, not causality. In this paper, we hypothesize that the reductions in Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) observed in hypertension and obesity can explain many abnormalities observed in SARS-CoV-2 and question the role of treatments interfering with ACE2.']}\n",

In an attempt to contain the speed of dissemination of the new virus between and within territories, the WHO (2020) adopted several health measures, based both on the evolution of the disease and the analysis of cases that occurred between countries in Asia and Europe. Such measures have so far ranged from social isolation, surveillance of cases coming from epidemic areas, and increasing public awareness to infection control in health facilities (2) .', 'Among the health facilities that are very crowded and that can be a space of virus transmission, the gymnasium, and sports facilities stand out.
